    "sentence": ["I treat others the way I want to be treated.",
        "I am a tough person who has made it through tough times.",
        "I don’t know whether I was born with it, raised to be, or cultivated it — probably all three — but I refuse to accept anything other than the idea that the day after tomorrow will be better than today. It’s a great source of motivation to work hard and do my best, and it’s made my life a lot more fun in countless ways.",
        "I’m book-smart. It’s not a free ride to success, but it’s allowed me to breeze through a lot of things with ease that other people deem complete hell (like school). Sure, I overthink everything, but I can also wiggle out of a lot of situations where being dumbstruck just wouldn’t do.",
        "Terrible puns. If there’s a bad wordplay to be made, I’m there. Life’s too short to skip the crappy jokes. So I take one for the team and make them. And then I laugh about them anyway. Often, it catches everyone else too. Mostly because of how embarrassing it was, but hey, a laugh is a laugh.",
        "The number of TV show lines, inspiring quotes, random facts and song lyrics stored in my brain is mind-boggling. I used to think this was useless for the longest time but now, as a writer, I never seem to run out of references and ideas to connect things to. Score!",
        "I have a really great smug face. It says “I told you so” and “couldn’t help myself” and “bet you didn’t expect that” all at the same time. Maybe that’s why it always triggers a hilarious response in the person who sees it and then we all laugh together. Love it.",
        "I’m definitely OCD when it comes to cleaning and organizing. And while I waste a ton of time checking if I have my keys for the third time, I also rarely forget anything. Locking myself out, losing my wallet, not knowing where my phone is, these almost never happen to me.",
        "Rationality. This wasn’t always the case, but thanks to my obsession with self-improvement, you can now tell me something doesn’t make sense, and if it doesn’t, I’ll agree with you and change my mind. Speaking of which…",
        "We live in a world where success depends on your brand and all brands must stand for something. Therefore, most people stick with their opinions, but it makes no sense. You’re human. All you do is change. We should applaud people who publicly change their mind, not trash them. From Walt Whitman: “I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes.",
        "I’m too nice. I’ll have the busiest week of my life yet still say yes to revising your CV if you ask me. I had to learn not to get taken advantage of, but I’d still rather have it this way than being too selfish.",
        "When a catchy song is playing, my body is moving. A slight head nod, a tap of my foot, a swaggering step on the street, you are not getting this infection with music out of me. Ever. And it is contagious. It lifts people’s spirits when they see it. Not to mention my own.",
        "You can read my face like a book. There might be some situations when this is bad like, you know, actual poker, but most of the time, it makes communication a lot easier. And god knows we need that.",
        "Minimalism. This is definitely an acquired taste that was born out of necessity, but it grew into an amazing source of time, energy, and happiness — although none of those things are front and center. To me, minimalism is about making room to solve true problems in your life. To find the resilience to carry on with little when life takes things from you.",
        "I weigh 140 lbs, give or take. Weighing less means eating less, paying less, processing less, spending less energy on making energy. Plus, it means I’m really good at stuff like push-ups, which are a great form of bodyweight exercise. This makes my life simpler and, thus, better.",
        "I’m really good at things like balancing and all sports that involve toggling, hitting, catching or throwing balls. It’s good for fun and party tricks, but it also means I rarely drop things, I can close doors even when my hands are full and I can type fast. Kinda neat for a writer!",
        "Where I grew up, we don’t slam doors. We sit straight at the table and put our devices away. We say “hello” and “bye” and “thank you.” I’m no Brad Pitt so I can only imagine how much this has — sometimes literally — opened doors for me in life. Manners are a very basic form of respect and, again, one that’s often missing today. Check.",
        "People tell me my voice is very calm. When I did Instagram stories every day, some would listen to them to fall asleep. If that’s not a compliment, I don’t know what is. Can’t sing to save my life, though.",
        "My BS detector is pretty good which, luckily, extends to my own. When a 22-year-old yobbo tells me about all he’s done, but can’t back up any of it, I call BS. And when I tell people something that’s not true or that I haven’t lived through, I call BS. Better for everyone this way.",
        "When my ex-girlfriend challenged me to drop coffee, I went cold turkey on the spot for 100 days. When I decide to add a new piece of writing to my roster every week, I publish it every week. It took a long time to get there, but being able to change your behavior at with a snap of your fingers is a priceless habit itself.",
        "Loyalty. If I’m your friend, I’m a real friend. Not a fair-weather one. I write, I call, I check in with you. Sometimes, it takes me a while, but I always answer. We all drift apart from people here and there, but for the ones where it counts, I can at least say I make every effort not to.",
        "I love new tech. I love learning about it, thinking about it, experiencing it. Even if I’m never going to use it. And if you put me in front of something I’ve never seen before, I’ll figure it out. I think this will be a huge advantage when I’m 60, 70, 80 years old.",
        "Romantic. I’m such a Ted Mosby. As I get older, I tone it down and avoid the creepy, not-at-all romantic stuff, but I’ll always be a hopeless ball of goo at heart — and I have a feeling it’s gonna come in handy one day.",
        "The effort I've put in and how I've become mentally healthy (or at least pretty much. At least, more than I was.)",
        "My handwriting",
        "My fashine sense",
        "My intellect",
        "My long hair",
        "My smile"
